# Megaboard PHP
Rewrite of the original Megaboard in PHP 4 (archive)

###OLD CODE WARNING! :)

This is an archive of my rewritten message board script. It is written in procedural PHP 4 and stores data in tab-delimitted flat-files, much like its predecessor.

It adds new features such as vastly improved administration and moderation, as well as a rudimentary "skin" system, though it does not support proper templating.

It is rough by today's standards and extremely insecure, but now it will live forever on Github!
