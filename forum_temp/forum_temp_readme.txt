Megaboard PHP v4.0
- Notice about Temporary files.
-------------------------------

This directory stores temporary files generated by the forum.  Normally these files are deleted immediately by the forum.  If you see any files in this directory with the prefix "temp_count_", you may need to update the forum counters through the administration panel.  Also, if you see any files with the prefis "temp_index_", you probably need to rebuild the forum indexes through the admin panel.  

If temporary files are left in this folder, it means that a file update process was probably killed before it could finish.  This could affect the accuracy of the forum counters and thread lists.  This is a problem with the CGI or fast-CGI version of PHP for Apache.  To reduce the likeliness of this problem.  Have your web administrator install mod_php4 on your Apache server.
